---

# Difficulties we were Facing

- Support multiple targets
- Support multiple configurations
- Interact with multiple serial devices
- Support multiple OS and platforms


---

# Tools We Developed for CI/CD

- `idf-build-apps`

    A tool to build multiple ESP-IDF applications simply in CI

    - Repo: https://github.com/espressif/idf-build-apps
    - Documentation: https://docs.espressif.com/projects/idf-build-apps/en/latest/

- `pytest-embedded`

    A pytest plugin that designed for embedded testing

    - Repo: https://github.com/espressif/pytest-embedded
    - Documentation: https://docs.espressif.com/projects/pytest-embedded/en/latest/

- Project
- Configuration
- Target
- Application

---

## Key Features

- Build matrix for multiple targets and configurations
- Manifest file for fine-grained control over the build matrix
- Skip build if the app is not modified, or the dependencies are not changed

---

# `pytest-embedded`

<img src="images/pytest-process.svg">

---

## Key Features

- Support all operating systems and platforms
- Run on different platforms without any code change
- Automatically setup firmware while setup

---

# Same Script, Different Platformâ€‹

```python
# test_hello_world.py
from pytest_embedded_idf import IdfDut

def test_hello_world(dut: IdfDut):
    dut.expect("Hello World!")
```

## Test ESP-IDF Project on Real Target

```shell
pytest --embedded-services esp,idf
```

## Test arduino-esp32 Project

```shell
pytest --embedded-services esp,arduino
```

## Test ESP-IDF Project with QEMU

```shell
pytest --embedded-services idf,qemu
```

# Different Platforms

## Test with Real Targets

Self-hosted runners on GitHub Actions - https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/managing-self-hosted-runners/about-self-hosted-runners

## Test with QEMU

Qemu is still under beta testing, but you can try it now.
